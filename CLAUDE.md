## Guiding Principles

**Scientific**: Emphasize correctness, reproducibility, and detailed logging for auditability.

**Modular**: Design components to be added or changed with minimal impact on others.

**Practical**: Do science, not programming contests. Don't over-engineer or prematurely optimize.

**Privacy Respecting**: Treat data with care. Design with clear data governance.

**Self Improving**: Learn from earlier experiments to improve future work.

**Tested**: Write tests alongside development. Focus on critical functionality, not coverage metrics.
